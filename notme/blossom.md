so cold and so hot, so untimely,
so obscured, so dark and so shiny
tear the night till it bleeds deadly wounded
I know, and I will, and I want it

Seek for my voice on the phone,
My kiss on the window is frozen
The stigma of you on my skin -
My blossom

Saying goodbye in a round
Taking off from the ground
No pain, and no right to look forward
Too strong, and too pure, and too over.
