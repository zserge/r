Taking off your evening dress
Hiding away from my eyes
Uncover the velvet skin of your back
With a pair of ivory scars

Silently crying the loss of
Something I used to adore
Where is your pair of wings
I've been so passionate for?

Where are your wings I've been so passionate for?

The leisure time slipped away
And we're constantly occupied
Proving that weakness loses the fight,
Proving that black is white

We know there was no winners
On this delirious war
Tell me where are your wings
I've been so passionate for?

I'm not asking about money
About your men and affairs
I see have fear of open windows
And rarely go upstairs

And if our house goes up in flames
And we cannot escape the top floor
We will perish without your pair of wings
I've been so passionate for?
