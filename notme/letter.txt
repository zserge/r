Am                                  Dm6
I wish you were caught by the pouring rain
                                F6-5
Some night in July on the Latvian bay
           C#/-9              Am
And you haven't seen the enchantment of rays.

A wave you caress takes your hand to enwrap,
The sand and the stones keeping every your step
In the centuries-old everlasting landscape.

I wish you were here to let us again
Buy the same tickets catching a train
Going from station to something arcane

The frame of the carriage window won't place
The pristine romance of Shakespearean plays
And we won't wake up in each others embrace.

   Am    Dm6       F6-5        C#/-9              Am
One AM. Finally came to a full stop a fool that I am.
Post. Address. I won't write a single line, no more and no less.

Mute. Sound. In the thickness of nights the silence dictates my rhythm,
Dancing around the scrawls I write, but you may not ever read 'em.

Thoughts. Rhymes. Whispered lights and echoes make me rejoice.
Dial. Many times. Trying to call you just to hear your voice.

Statue. Standing. Motionless. Conceiling itself like a villain.
Edges. Verges. I love. There can't be a reciprocal feeling.
